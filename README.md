# Take5

## To do

- [X] rework the model so that hands and players are stored in a unique map
- [ ] document all errors of the Model module
- [ ] merge the start and deal functions (start should deal the cards)
- [X] clean up / refactor the tests of the Model module to fight duplication and improve readability
- [ ] assess the benefits of using a Result monad for the return type of functions of the Model module
